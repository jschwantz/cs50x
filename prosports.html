                I grew up an Atlanta sports fan, with being born outside Atlanta and having most all extended family from there.
                Falcons, Braves, Hawks.

                Having grown up watching Matt Stafford, and spending time in Michigan, I've come to love on the Lions and their perrenial mediocrity.

                College in Nashville came with the territory of pulling for the Titans and Thrashers.
